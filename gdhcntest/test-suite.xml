	<!--
		This is the test suite's entry point file as it points to the test cases which in turn point to other scriptlets and resources. In general there is
		no requirement on the structure of a test suite but it is a good practice to keep things organised with a consistent structure that makes sense to you
		(e.g. a "test_cases" folder for the test cases, a "scriptlets" folder for scriptlets, "resources" for files to import etc.).

		The test case IDs refer to the IDs of the relevant test cases (see their root element). You can place test cases anywhere you want in the test suite archive
		and they will be picked up automatically when parsing the test suite.

		Note that as part of the same test suite you can have test cases for different SUT actors. In our case we have a single test suite with test cases both for 
		the FHIR client and FHIR server roles. Alternatively these could of course be split into separate test suites but that is not necessary.
